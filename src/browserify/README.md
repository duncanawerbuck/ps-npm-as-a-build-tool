# Browserify Example

* This folder contains the files necessary to demo the "Bundling with Browserify" example in the course module "Scripts for Development and Test".
* ```main.js``` is the entry point, and uses a ```require ``` statement to state its dependency on a module defined in and exported from the other file (```foo.js```).
