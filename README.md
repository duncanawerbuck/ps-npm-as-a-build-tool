## Modules

(we're ignoring the intro module below)
### 1. Get started
* Introduction to defining scripts, starting with ones that simply echo text.
* Install ```mocha``` (testing framework) and ```should``` (a popular assertion library)

### 2. Pre- & post hooks
### 3. Develop and test scripts
### 4. Scripts for watching
### 5. Build & reply scripts
### 6. Put it all together "Deploy to prod"
